# map-reduce-python

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can implement MapReduce in Python using Hadoop on an EC2 instance in AWS:

Set Up Hadoop on EC2:

1- Prepare Data:

Upload your input data to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or make it accessible to Hadoop. HDFS is the file system used by Hadoop to store data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster.

2- Write Mapper Function:

Create a Python script that defines your mapper function. The mapper function takes input data and emits key-value pairs.

3- Write Reducer Function:

Similarly, create a Python script that defines your reducer function. The reducer function takes the output of the mapper function (key-value pairs) and performs the necessary aggregation or computation.

4- Run MapReduce Job:

Use Hadoop Streaming to run your MapReduce job. Hadoop Streaming is a utility that allows you to create and run MapReduce jobs with any executable or script as the mapper and/or reducer.

5- Submit Job to Hadoop:

Submit your MapReduce job to Hadoop by specifying the mapper and reducer scripts, input data location, output data location, and any other necessary parameters.

6- Monitor Job Progress:

Monitor the progress of your MapReduce job using Hadoop's web interface or command-line tools. You can track the status of the job, view logs, and analyze performance metrics.

7- Retrieve Output:

Once the MapReduce job completes successfully, retrieve the output data from the specified output location in HDFS or wherever it was directed to store the results.
